## Requirements

App Center Command Line Interface (CLI) must be installed, and Cake.AppCenter does not work without it (error will be *AppCenter: Could not locate executable.* if you try to use Cake.AppCenter without appcenter-cli). This can be done by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first, and then by using **npm** from command-line/terminal

```
npm install -g appcenter-cli
```

or run with sudo if you get permission errors

```
sudo npm install -g appcenter-cli
```

## Including addin
Including addin in cake script is easy.
```
#addin "Cake.AppCenter"
```
## Usage

To use the addin just add it to Cake call the aliases and configure any settings you want.

```csharp
#addin "Cake.AppCenter"

...

// How to login using a token
Task("Login")
	.Does(() => {
		// or more containers at once
		AppCenterLogin(new AppCenterLoginSettings{ Token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" });
	)};
```
Other commands follow same convention.

This version is built against AppCenter CLI tools version 1.0.16.
